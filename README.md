# Bitcoin-Sentiment-Analysis

This research explored how social media networks influence individuals' moods based on the text they share. The findings indicate that by leveraging platforms like Twitter, it is possible to analyze people's sentiments about specific topics and provide real-time insights to relevant authorities regarding public opinion. The study utilized open-source Python libraries on Google Colab and datasets from Kaggle, specifically focusing on tweets and Bitcoin prices. Data preprocessing was performed to eliminate irrelevant text and columns from the original datasets before conducting exploratory analysis, which was essential for classifying tweets by sentiment.

The research aimed to understand how people view Bitcoin on Twitter and its relationship with Bitcoin's price, which could aid in predicting price fluctuations. Given the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the analysis included a total of 1,173,440 tweets collected over a year, from January 2020 to January 2021. Automated Sentiment Analysis was employed to assess whether public sentiment could forecast Bitcoin's market trends.

In this study, the sentiment of Twitter users regarding cryptocurrency was evaluated using VADER sentiment analyzers. The results revealed that most users held positive views, with the VADER analyzer indicating 59.05% positive, 35.50% neutral, and 5.46% negative sentiments, reflecting a generally positive outlook among users. Additionally, a topic modelling analysis was performed using LDA to identify the frequency of ten topics within the corpus. Finally, inter-topic multidimensional scaling was applied to visualize the findings. 

Cross-correlation analysis was also conducted to investigate the connection between user perceptions and Bitcoin prices.
